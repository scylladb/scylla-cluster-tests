# This is a test case for having 90% disk utilization with a lot of small tables.
# The data is split equally among 500 tables.
# The dataset size is aligned with 'i4i.xlarge'.
# It uses a c-s user-profile template for all 500 tables.
# It runs 4 batches of 125 tables each.
# On each batch cycle, 125 tables are created, then a load is generated for all of these tables.
# When all the 125 stress writes/reads are done, it continue with the next batch until stress to all 500 tables is completed (after 4 cycles).
# Each one of the 500 tables has both write and read load.
