### Batch Ratio Distribution Specifications ###

# Insert is used only to propagate data into the dataset. This is only query that supports batches,
#   it is actually works only thru batches.
# In order to call it add it to the ops statement: 'ops(insert=1,...)'
# It overrides custom query 'insert' if it is defined
# batch size maximum is hardcoded to 65535, it can be limiting row number in partition for
#   big row insertation, by setting 'partitions' key to fixed(X)

insert: # SchemaInsert.java, does batched prepared statements insert
  partitions: fixed(2)
  select:    fixed(2)/10240M
  batchtype: UNLOGGED

# After running "ops(insert=1) n=1000000" you will get ~1m records with ~1.3k avg row size
#   across ~895k partitions, table size will be ~1.3g

queries:
   ck-select: # SchemaQuery.java: not batched execution
      cql: select * from targettable where pk = ? and ck = ?
      fields: samerow
   pk-select: # SchemaQuery.java: not batched execution
     cql: select * from targettable where pk = ?
     fields: samerow
   null-insert: # SchemaQuery.java: not batched execution
      cql: insert into targettable(pk, ck, c1, c3, c6) values (?,?,?,?,?)
      fields: samerow
