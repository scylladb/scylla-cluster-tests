# In order to have EKS Cluster created you need to provide subnets from two different availability zone
# otherwise it will fail due to the validation.
# At the same time Scylla Operator can't work properly when nodes within one rack are deployed into
#  different availability zones.
# To make it work when node groups are created we pick subnets only from first availability zone
# As result you need to specify two AZ to make it work, but scylla will occupy resources only from first one
