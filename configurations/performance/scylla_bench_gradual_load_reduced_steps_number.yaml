# Define load ops for steps
# # For debugging, you can set a specific thread count for each step (per load).
## The value of perf_gradual_threads[load] must be either:
##   - a single-element list or integer (applied to all throttle steps)
##   - a list with the same length as perf_gradual_throttle_steps[load] (one thread count per step).

# Nuber of threads is adjusted based on the test results: https://github.com/scylladb/qa-tasks/issues/1862#issuecomment-3592963501
